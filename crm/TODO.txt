make email and mobile mandatory

re \"\"http://crm.roo.ie/settings.php\"\" is this for inputting data from a csv file?

in the Legend box, i dont think the girls will understand this

so users have 2 ways of importing data into the crm
1 upload cv and populate http://crm.roo.ie/add.php
2 upload cv and upload csv file, the csv file will populate http://crm.roo.ie/add.php

we could provide an eg. csv file

your thoughts?
=============================

re changing
im thinking of €50 per month for every 4 users
so if they want a 5th user/login its another €50
the more users the more support that will be required.
=============================

should we add a button/function so that an admin user can do a manual backup?
=============================
