<p><strong>gbPlayer5 | HTML 5 Video Player</strong></p>
<p><strong>gbPlayer5</strong> is a JavaScript  plugin for jQuery that makes it easier to work with and build on HTML5 video, today. This is also known as an "HTML5 Video Player". <strong>gbPlayer5</strong> provides a common controls skin built in HTML/CSS, cross-browser compatibility, and adds additional features like browser/real fullscreen.</p>
<p><strong>What is HTML5 Video?</strong></p>
<p>HTML is the markup language that makes up every page on the web. The newest version, HTML5, includes specifications for a &lt;video&gt; tag, that's meant to allow web developers to add a video to a page in the same way they would add an image. In order for this to work, web browser developers have built video playback functionality into their browsers.</p>
<p>Playing video in a web page may not seem so special since you can already view video on a web page through plugins like Flash Player, Quicktime, and Silverlight. However, this is actually a big step forward for standardizing video playback across web browsers and devices. The goal is that in the future, developers will only need to use one method for embedding a video, based on open standards (not controlled by one company), and it will work everywhere. Additionally, HTML5 video can improve video performance by not requiring a second application (a plugin) to be running, and opens the door to creating interactions between video and other elements on the page that hasn't been possible before.</p>
<p><strong>What is an HTML5 Video Player?</strong></p>
An HTML5 Video Player is a JavaScript library that builds a custom set of controls over top of the HTML5 video element using jQuery in order to provide a consistent look between HTML5 browsers.
<p><strong>gbPlayer5</strong> is HTML5 compliant and uses the latest version of jQuery available from googleapis.com library.</p>
